Under construction...
I am a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of Oxford, working with Prof. Martin Bureau as part of the [WISDOM](https://wisdom-project.org/) collaboration on measuring supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses using ALMA molecular gas kinematics. Before joining Oxford, I was an undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara, where I worked on direct imaging of exoplanets.

My research revolves around mysteries of SMBHs and their co-evolution with galaxies. Solving these mysteries requires measuring how the masses of SMBHs relate to properties of their host galaxies across cosmic time. I use ultra-high-resolution ALMA observations to (1) measure the SMBH masses of local galaxies to unprecedented precision and (2) measure the SMBH masses of high-redshift galaxies using dynamical methods for the first time. Check out the Research page for details of my work.
